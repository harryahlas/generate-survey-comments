# generate-survey-comments
Generate artificial survey comments based on real data.

**in early stages of development**

See *seq2seqcomments.ipynb* for model and training.

Shoot me a note if you would like the training data set, ~4k comments. It is based off publicly available comments, mostly from *data.world*.
